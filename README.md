# ground-motion-interpolation

Matlab code to illustrate calculations for exploring conditioning ground motion IMs with uncertainty. The basic script, shakemap_basic_illustrative_calc.m, currently considers two parameters along a 1D line segment, for simplity of bookkeeping. Inter-IM and distance correlations are also Markovian, for simplicity.

This script was used to produce results for the following manuscript, which provides context and background for the calculations:

Worden, Thompson, Baker, Bradley, Luco, Wald, (2017), "Spatial and Spectral Interpolation of Ground Motion Intensity Measure Observations" (in review).
